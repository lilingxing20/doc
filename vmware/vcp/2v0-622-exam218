QUESTION 12
Which two statements correctly describe VM-Host affinity rules? (Choose two.)
*
A. When there is more than one VM-Host affinity rule in a vSphere DRS cluster, the rules are applied equally.
B. After creating a VM-Host affinity rule, its ability to function in relation to other rules is predetermined.
C. When there is more than one VM-Host affinity rule in a vSphere DRS cluster, the rules will be ranked.
D. After creating a VM-Host affinity rule, its ability to function in relation to other rules is not checked.
*
Correct Answer: AD
*
Section: (none)
Explanation
Explanation/Reference:
If you create more than one VM-Host affinity rule, the rules are not ranked, but are applied equally. Be aware
that this has implications for how the rules interact. For example, a virtual machine that belongs to two DRS
groups, each of which belongs to a different required rule, can run only on hosts that belong to both of the host
DRS groups represented in the rules.
When you create a VM-Host affinity rule, its ability to function in relation to other rules is not checked. So it is
possible for you to create a rule that contacts with the other rules you are using. When two VM-Host affinity
rules conflict, the older one takes precedence and the newer rule is disabled. DRS only tries to satisfy enabled
rules and disabled rules are ignored.

QUESTION 17
How can failback of a recovered virtual machine in vSphere Replication be performed?

A. No action required, because failback is automatically performed to the source site.
B. Configure a new replication in the reverse direction at the target site.
C. Disable or Stop the virtual machine replication on the source site.
D. Power off and unregister the virtual machine on the target site.
*
Correct Answer: B
*
Section: (none)
Explanation
Explanation/Reference:
Failback of Virtual Machines in vSphere Replication
Failback of virtual machines is a manual task in a vSphere Replication.
After performing a successful recovery from the primary site to the secondary site, you can perform failback.
You manually configure a new replication in the reverse direction, that is, from the secondary site to the primary
site. The disks of the primary site are used as replication seeds, so that vSphere Replication only synchronizes
the changes made to the .vmdk files. Before you configure the reverse replication, you must manually
unregister the virtual machine from the inventory on the primary site.

QUESTION 50
An administrator finds that the Microsoft Exchange virtual machines are exhibiting network latency.
What two in-guest changes can help decrease latency? (Choose two.)
*
A. LRO
B. TSO
C. SR-IOV
D. PVRDMA
*
Correct Answer: AB
*
Section: (none)
Explanation
Explanation/Reference:
Using TSO and LRO on physical and virtual machine NICs improves the performance of ESX/ESXi hosts by
reducing the CPU overhead for TCP/IP network operations. The host uses more CPU cycles to run
applications.
If TSO is enabled on the transmission path, the NIC divides larger data chunks into TCP segments. If TSO is
disabled, the CPU performs segmentation for TCP/IP.
TSO is referred to as LSO (Large Segment Offload or Large Send Offload) in the latest VMXNET3 driver
attributes.
LRO reassembles incoming network packets into larger buffers and transfers the resulting larger but fewer
packets to the network stack of the host or virtual machine. The CPU has to process fewer packets than when
LRO is disabled, which reduces its utilization for networking.

*
Section: (none)
Explanation
Explanation/Reference:
Memory Ballooning is the memory reclamation technique used by hypervisor to reclaim the memory back from
the virtual machine.
When ESXi host running low on physical memory, It uses ballooning driver (vmmemctl.sys) to determine the
how much memory from virtual machines can be get back to prevent the hypervisor swapping.

B. It sets allowed. All flag to TRUE.
C. It sets allowed. All flag to FALSE.
D. It opens port 2049.
*
Correct Answer: BD
*
Section: (none)
Explanation
Explanation/Reference:
NFS v4.1 Firewall Behavior
When you mount the first NFS v4.1 datastore, ESXI enables the nfs41client rule set and sets its allowedAll flag
to TRUE. This action opens port 2049 for all IP address. Unmounting an NFS v4.1 datastore does not affect the
firewall state. That is, the first NFS v4.1 mount opens port 2049 and that port remains enabled unless you close
it explicitly.

A Telco customer is implementing NFV using vSphere as the virtualization platform.
Which feature can help achieve a high packet rate with lower CPU consumption?
*
A. Network I/O Control
B. SplitRX
C. ERSPAN
D. LACP
*
Correct Answer: B
*
Section: (none)
Explanation
Explanation/Reference:
SplitRx Mode
SplitRx mode uses multiple physical CPUs to process network packets received in a single network queue.
This feature can significantly improve network performance for certain workloads. These workloads include:
Multiple virtual machines on one ESXi host all receiving multicast traffic from the same source. (SplitRx mode
will typically improve throughput and CPU efficiency for these workloads.)
Traffic via the vNetwork Appliance (DVFilter) API between two virtual machines on the same ESXi host.
(SplitRx mode will typically improve throughput and maximum packet rates for these workloads.)
In vSphere 5.1 and later this feature is automatically enabled for a VMXNET3 virtual network adapter (The only
adapter type on which it is supported) when ESXi detects that a single network queue on a physical NIC is both
(a) heavily utilized and (b) getting more that 10,000 broadcast/multicast packets per second.

The two traffic categories have different nature. System traffic is strictly associated with an ESXi host. The
network traffic routes change when you migrate a virtual machine across the environment. To provide network
resources to a virtual machine regardless of its host, in Network I/O Control you can configure resource
allocation for virtual machines that is valid in the scope of the entire distributed switch.
Bandwidth Guarantee to Virtual Machines
Network I/O Control version 3 provisions bandwidth to the network adapters of virtual machines by using
constructs of shares, reservation and limit. Based on these constructs, to receive sufficient bandwidth,
virtualized workloads can rely on admission control in vSphere Distributed Switch, vSphere DRS and vSphere
HA

Which two options can optimize conversion with VMware Converter? (Choose two.)
*
A. Disable real-time antivirus scanners.
B. Remove the source from Active Directory.
C. Remove third-party device drivers.
D. Exclude diagnostic partitions from conversion.
E. Disable Volume Shadow Copy (VSS).
*
Correct Answer: AD
*
Section: (none)
Explanation
Explanation/Reference:
*
Correct Answer: AD
Optimizing the conversion for best success
To set up conversion for the best success:
If you are encountering failures with Converter, reduce the number of optional items in the Conversion Wizard:
Do not convert diagnostic partitions or unrecognized file systems.
If you are experiencing cloning phase failures, do not choose to resize the partitions.
If there are multiple volumes, attempt converting only the system volume.
If you are experiencing network or Ethernet issues, trying using a different network type.
Leave the default number of virtual network cards (NICs) unaltered. The number of virtual NICs can be
changed after conversion has completed.
Deselect the option to install VMware Tools.
Deselect the option to perform Customization on the virtual machine.
To prepare for conversion:
If the source is a domain controller, special considerations must be made. VMware does not recommend
virtualizing an active domain controller with Converter.
If the source is Microsoft Exchange, SQL, or other database server, VMware recommends that the
application (Microsoft Exchange/SQL) and database services be shut down prior to conversion. This
minimizes any chance of corrupted database tables or stale data in the destination virtual machine.
Disable the real-time antivirus scanning during the conversion.

Which two items are required to enable NPIV in a virtual machine? (Choose two.)
*
A. use of physical RDMs
B. physical HBA support
C. use of virtual disks
D. hardware version 11 or higher
*
Correct Answer: AB
*
Section: (none)
Explanation
Explanation/Reference:
*
Correct Answer: AB
NPIV support is subject to the following limitations:
■NPIV must be enabled on the SAN switch. Contact the switch vendor for information about enabling
NPIV on their devices.
■NPIV is supported only for virtual machines with RDM disks. Virtual machines with regular virtual disks
continue to use the WWNs of the host’s physical HBAs.
■The physical HBAs on the ESXi host must have access to a LUN using its WWNs in order for any virtual
machines on that host to have access to that LUN using their NPIV WWNs. Ensure that access is provided to
both the host and the virtual machines.
■The physical HBAs on the ESXi host must support NPIV. If the physical HBAs do not support NPIV, the virtual
machines running on that host will fall back to using the WWNs of the host’s physical HBAs for LUN access.
■Each virtual machine can have up to 4 virtual ports. NPIV-enabled virtual machines are assigned exactly 4
NPIV-related WWNs, which are used to communicate with physical HBAs through virtual ports. Therefore,
virtual machines can utilize up to 4 physical HBAs for NPIV purposes
